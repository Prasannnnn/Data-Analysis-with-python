GRADING SCHEME
---> The minimum passing mark for the course is 70% with the following weights:
===> 50% - All Review Questions 
===> 50% - The Final Exam
Though Review Questions and the Final Exam have a passing mark of 50% each, the only grade that matters is the overall grade for the course.
Review Questions have no time limit. You are encouraged to review the course material to find the answers as this counts for 50% of your mark.
---> The final exam has a 1-hour time limit.
---> Attempts are per question in both, the Review Questions and the Final Exam:
---> One attempt - For True/False questions
---> Two attempts - For any question other than True/False
---> There are no penalties for incorrect attempts.
---> Clicking the "Final Check" button when it appears, means your submission is FINAL.  
You will NOT be able to resubmit your answer for that question again.
---> Check your grades in the course at any time by clicking on the "Progress" tab.
