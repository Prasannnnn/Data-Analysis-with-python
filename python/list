Concept: Develop a smart basket billing system for textile shops that scans items via barcodes, adds them to a digital bill, and offers seamless QR code or card payment options.
Innovation: Modernize the shopping experience with automated billing, reducing checkout times and enhancing customer convenience.
Technology: Utilize a combination of barcode scanners, microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi/Arduino), and backend software for real-time billing and payment processing.
Market: Target textile retailers looking to integrate advanced technology solutions for improved operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Scalability: Start with a few pilot installations, gather feedback, refine the system, and gradually scale to multiple stores, revolutionizing the textile retail industry.
